# Retrospective

## How did you do this sprint?
### Responses from team members:
- I felt that this sprint was productive for me, not only for getting work done, but also for working with the team and developing a stronger understanding of the project and the code behind it. I was able to work on the SPA for the home page, and I worked on the search functionality.
- Pretty good, I managed to accomplish all the tasks that I set out to do and had some spare time to better integrate everything together and make the software more intuitive to use from the user perspective.
- I thought I did well, I was able to help complete the search functionality as well as integrate jest into our grunt automation.
- I've been excited and stressful at the same time.
- Not too bad, but I wish I could have done more
- Managed several tasks at the same time well
- good so far
- great

## Where and when did it go wrong in this sprint?
### Responses from team members: 
- I feel that the only thing that went wrong was having deadlines and some communication between people of different tasks. This was mostly because of how busy everyone's schedules have been, and finding time to work on the project with the team. For example, some features needed to be completed before other tasks, such as front-end designing, could be started. Also, the unit testing could've had more people involved I felt, but people were already assigned to their own tasks, so that was something to figure out. These are things to look out for, but everything still seemed to go pretty smoothly.
- I think it might have been better to get more people working on the front end sooner since the styling of our website seems to be lagging behind the rapid development of features/functionality.
- I fee I gained a lot of experience not went wrong. All the materials for me was new, so I did a lot of mistake.
- sorry that because other courses and my ability, I cannot contribute so much in this project
- Not any major hiccups, but the question of what to test is still hovering
- Everything went well as expected
- Just a lot of homework overall.

## If you could change 1 thing, what would it be?
### Responses from team members: 
- I would probably want to clean up our codebase a little bit since there are a lot of files and potentially unnecessary bloat.
- For an app concern one thing I'm wondering about is the "Seasonal recipes" idea - I'm not sure how we will implement that.
- If I could change 1 thing, I would have spent a little less time relaxing over Thanksgiving Break.
- I would set better soft deadlines for tasks, and put more people/attention towards unit testing.
- register for 3 classes this quarter, so that I will have more time investing in this project
- to give more details about the labs and concept at first sessions.

## What should we do differently next time?
### Responses from team members: 
- Communicate more as a team to figure these things out, and make sure that everyone is making progress on their task so that everyone is updated in a timely fashion.
- More communication on progress of features, and how the rest of us can use the features implemented and use it in our own implementations.
- if you could provide a view of the role and what we would learn by doing the labs, I would choose the different role.
- Maybe one thing would be to assign tasks to people who aren't present at the meeting when tasks are assigned
- have a more concrete design plan at earlier time to make sure everyone is on the same page from early on
- I think it is better to write the process more detailed
- More communication
- Nothing
