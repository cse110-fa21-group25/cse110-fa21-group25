This project is a "CRUD" web-app that allows users to create, manage, update, and delete recipes from a recipe manager. The purpose of our application is that we wanted to build an application for people who are interested in starting out cooking that will not scare them off. Instead, we want our application to increase the productivity in their life based on the user friendliness we incorporated and satisfy the user’s needs via our recipe management features. Additionally, our web-app allows users to save their data using our user-authentication which requires you to create an account in order to view all of your created recipes, delete/update any of your own recipes on the "My Page" tab.
